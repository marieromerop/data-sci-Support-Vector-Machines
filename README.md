# data-sci-Support-Vector-Machines

Hello, 

The purpose of this repository is for resume purposes, to display the previous work i have completed in the domain of data science 
by way of my courses. Please see the html and pdf files for ease of view if you do not have access to a virtual environment like 
jupyter notebook or google colab that views python notebook files (.ipynb). This task focused on generating support vector machines and using GridSearch Cross Validation to select the optimal parameters needed. 

Best, Eugenia.
